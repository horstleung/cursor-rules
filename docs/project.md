# Project Overview

## Goals
- Create a maintainable, scalable, and well-documented codebase
- Establish clear coding standards and architectural guidelines
- Automate quality checks and documentation processes
- Ensure consistent dependency management
- Promote modular and testable code design
- Implement robust error handling and logging

## Project Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Modern, component-based UI with clean separation from business logic
- **Backend**: API-driven design with proper layering (controllers, services, repositories)
- **Infrastructure**: Configuration as code, containerized deployment, automated CI/CD
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, error tracking, and monitoring

## Development Standards
The project adheres to the following standards, as defined in the Cursor rules:

1. Architectural Consistency
2. Dependency Management
3. Code Modularity
4. Documentation Automation
5. Testing Standards
6. Code Style and Formatting
7. Error Handling and Logging

## Project Organization
Project files are organized according to their purpose and functionality, following the established architectural patterns.

## Workflow Process
