# General Workflow Rules

## Documentation Requirements
- Read the docs/project.md and docs/progress.md before starting any work
- Update docs/progress.md after completing significant features or changes
- Document all architectural decisions in appropriate documentation

## Code Development Practices
- Analyze the current codebase first to understand existing tools and components
- Make code reusable by following the modular design principles in code-modularity.mdc
- Maintain consistent architectural patterns as defined in architectural-consistency.mdc
- Follow code style and formatting guidelines from code-style-formatting.mdc
- Ensure proper documentation according to documentation-automation.mdc
- Write tests for all new code following testing-standards.mdc
- Manage dependencies according to dependency-management.mdc

## Project Structure
- Don't break the current folder structure; if changes are needed, consult with team members first
- Organize new code according to its purpose and responsibility
- Keep related functionality together

## Workflow Steps
1. Read docs/project.md and review git commits from the last checkpoint
2. Understand the project architecture and current state
3. Implement changes following all established rules
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Document changes in code and update relevant documentation
6. Update or generate docs/progress.md to create the latest checkpoint of project status
